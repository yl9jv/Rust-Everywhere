Rust-Everywhere
===============
A brief web tutorial that focuses on the differences between Rust programming language and other "traditional" languages. The user will be 
given several problems to lead him/her along the way of learning Rust. The user will also be able to enter their code on the web form or upload a file, and then the code will be run on our server. The web page will display the result or compilation error message. Therefore, the user can use Rust without even have Rust installed on their machine.

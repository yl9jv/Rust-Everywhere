Rust-Everywhere
===============
A brief web tutorial that focuses on the differences between Rust programming language and other "traditional" languages. The user will be provided with code in another language and asked to translate into Rust. These questions are chosen such that the main focus is on the essential differences, not just the syntax. Also, the user will be able to enter their code on the web form or upload a file and the code will be run on our server. The web page will then display the result or compilation error message. Therefore, the user do not need to install Rust on their machine.

This server can also serve as "Rust everywhere", meaning user can test their Rust code as long as the code are safe.

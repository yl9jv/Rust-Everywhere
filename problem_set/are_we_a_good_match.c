/*Q4: Are We A Good Match?
  Rust's match construct is a generalized, cleaned-up version of C's switch construct. You provide it with a value and a number of arms, each labelled with a pattern, and the code compares the value against each pattern in order until one matches. The matching pattern executes its corresponding arm.
Now you are given the following code in C:
*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int p = 4;
  switch (p) {
    case 0: printf("zero\n"); break;
    case 1: ;
    case 2: printf("one or two\n"); break;
    case 3: ;
    case 4: ;
    case 5: printf("three to five\n"); break;
    default: printf("something else\n");
  }
}

/*How would you translate that into Rust?*/
